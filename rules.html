<h3>Progress of Play</h3>

<p>A game is made up of 10 frames. Each frame represents one turn for the bowler, and in each turn the player is allowed to roll the ball twice. If the player knocks down all the pins with the first roll, it is a strike; if not, a second roll at the pins still standing is attempted. If all the pins are knocked down with two balls, it is a spare; if any pins are left standing, it is an "open frame."</p>

<p>If a bowler commits a foul, by stepping over the foul line during delivery, it counts as a shot, and any pins knocked down are re-spotted without counting. If pins are knocked down by a ball that has entered the gutter, or by a ball bouncing off the rear cushion, they do not count, and are re-spotted.</p>

<h3>Scoring</h3>

<p>In an open frame, a bowler simply gets credit for the number of pins knocked down. In the case of a <strong>spare</strong>, a slash mark is recorded in a small square in the upper right-hand corner of that frame on the score sheet, and no score is entered until the first ball of the next frame is rolled.</p>

<p>Then credit is given for 10 plus the number of pins knocked down with that next ball. For example, a player rolls a spare in the first frame; with the first ball of the second frame, the player knocks down seven pins. The first frame, then, gets 17 points. If two of the remaining three pins get knocked down, 9 pins are added, for a total of 26 in the second frame.</p>

<p>If a bowler gets a <strong>strike</strong>, it is recorded with an X in the small square, the score being 10 plus the total number of pins knocked down in the next two rolls. Thus, the bowler who rolls three strikes in a row in the first three frames gets credit for 30 points in the first frame.</p>

<p>Bowling's perfect score, a 300 game, represents 12 strikes in a row--a total of 120 pins knocked down. Why 12 strikes, instead of 10? Because, if a bowler gets a strike in the last frame, the score for that frame can't be recorded before rolling twice more. Similarly, if a bowler rolls a spare in the last frame, one more roll is required before the final score can be tallied.</p>

<h3>Lane Etiquette</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wait for the bowler to your right to deliver his/her ball if you're both bowling at about the same time.</li>
<li>Remain behind your fellow bowler while he/she is bowling.</li>
<li>Confine your bowling to your own lane.</li>
<li>Observe the foul line, even in casual play. Play fair.</li>
<li>Never bowl in street shoes.</li>
<li>Avoid using someone else's ball without permission.</li>
<li>Limit swearing and bad language as much as possible.</li>
<li>Be ready when it's your turn.</li>
</ul>
